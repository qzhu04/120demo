    <!-- A few sentences about a trip -->
    <p>My family had a road trip from Boston to San Diego last summer. We originally wanted to visit Yellowstone National Park for a week. Considering I had a dog that might be left unattended, we decided to drive to Yellowstone National Park. My daughter wanted to go to the San Diego Zoo, so our trip was extended there. On the way, we visited many interesting places, including Yosemite National Park, Antelope Canyon, Death Valley National Park, Zion and Bray National Park. We took one month to complete this trip as a result.</p>

    <p>My favorite food is a Korean dish called Bibimbap. It is made with pre-steamed rice placed in a stone pot, topped with a variety of vegetables, meats, fried eggs, and Korean hot sauce. To eat Bibimbap, you stir all the ingredients thoroughly and enjoy the mix of flavors!</p>
